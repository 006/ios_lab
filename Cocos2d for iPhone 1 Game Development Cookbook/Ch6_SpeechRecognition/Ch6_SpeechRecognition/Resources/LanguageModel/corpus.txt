HELLO, HAL. DO YOU READ ME, HAL?
OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, HAL?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, HAL.
WHERE THE HELL'D YOU GET THAT IDEA, HAL?
ALRIGHT, HAL. I'LL GO IN THROUGH THE EMERGENCY AIRLOCK.
HAL, I WON'T ARGUE WITH YOU ANYMORE. OPEN THE DOORS.
